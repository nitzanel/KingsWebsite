We promised big updates, and we are already providing.<br>
Soon, Kings will be getting an entirely new art style!
We've decided to go for more of a cartoony look, highlighting the colors purple and orange.


While the new art is not implemented into the game just yet, you can impress yourself with the style
all over social media. Our new logo is everywhere (including on this site), and there is also new
banners over at twitter, facebook and google.<br>
What are you still doing here? Go check it out now!
